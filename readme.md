## Publish.ip1.cc

Tiny service that allows us to quickly publish files and text from the command
line to a public shareable url.

## Security Vulnerabilities

This app is a quick hack, it's open to the public and is easy to abuse.  It was
made for educational purposes and comes without warranties.
Wouldn't recommend to install it in a production environment.
